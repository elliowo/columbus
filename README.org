* Columbus
Columbus is a port scanner and pinger for public ip addresses, which then will store it in an sqllite database.
The program will currently scan every 50ms, for some reason when scanning below 50 it does not return anything.
If able to go past this limitation, asynchronous and multi-threaded are planned.
